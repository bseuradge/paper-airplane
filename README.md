#### *Instructions:* 

1. Start off with an 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper (regular printer paper).

2. Fold sheet in half lengthwise and then unfold.

3. Fold upper corners of the piece of paper to the middle of the paper.

4. Keeping the upper corners folded, fold each top corner again lengthwise so that the fold meets the middle of the piece of paper *(Your piece of paper should look like a triangle)*. 

5. Fold the folder sides again so that they meet each other (i.e., are folded on top of each other)

6. Fold in half and open so that the folds open up to form wings.
